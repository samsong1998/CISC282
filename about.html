    <h1>About</h1>
    </div>
        <p>I&apos;ve been a resident of this city for the majority of my life and a homeowner in District 18 for the
        last decade. I truly enjoy living here and I want my efforts as a Councilor to have a positive impact
        on the city. Please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> with any ideas you might have to improve
        the municipality.</p>
    <section>
        <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I completed my <a href="https://catalogue.uottawa.ca/en/undergrad/honours-bsocsc-political-science/"> Honours degree in Public Administration and Political Science (BsocSc)</a>
            form the University of Ottawa followed by a <a href="http://localgovernment.uwo.ca/masters/index.html"> Master of
            Public Administration (MPA)</a> from Western University.</p>
        <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>I began my career working with the Commissioner of Community Services and, after many
            excellent years, I resigned to pursue municipal politics. I&apos;ve since had the pleasure of serving as the
            councillor for District 18 for over 8 years. I serve on both the Administrative Policies and Planning
            committees.</p>
